# Utils Plugin

A catch-all plugin for utility commands that don't fit into other specialized plugins.

## Purpose

This plugin serves as a temporary home for:
- One-off utility commands
- Helper commands that don't warrant their own plugin
- Experimental commands being developed
- Commands awaiting categorization

As related commands accumulate in this plugin, they can be moved to new specialized plugins.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install utils@kubevirt-ai-helpers
```

## Contributing

When adding new commands:
1. Add them to this utils plugin if they don't fit existing plugins
2. Once multiple related commands exist, consider creating a dedicated plugin
3. Follow the command format conventions from the hello-world plugin

## Commands

No commands are currently defined. This plugin serves as a placeholder for future utility commands.
